0.5.0:

* New supported platform: Macintosh Common Lisp (5.0 and up, plus RMCL)
* Support for UDP (datagram-usocket) was added (for all supported platform except MCL)
* Add WAIT-FOR-INPUT support for SBCL and ECL on win32.
* Simple TCP and UDP server API: SOCKET-SERVER
* Lots of bug fixed since 0.4.1

0.5.1:

* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixes for "SBCL/Win32: finalizer problem, etc", by Anton Kovalenko <anton@sw4me.com>
* Bugfix: SOCKET-CONNECT didn't set CONNECTED-P for datagram usockets on most backends.
* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixed SOCKET-SERVER (UDP) on SBCL due to a issue in SOCKET-CONNECT when HOST is NIL.
* Bugfix: [SBCL] SOCKET-CONNECT's TIMEOUT argument now works as a "connection timeout".
* Bugfix: [CMUCL] Fixed SOCKET-SEND on unconnected usockets under Unicode version of CMUCL.
* Enhancement: [LispWorks] Better network error type detection on LispWorks.
* Enhancement: SOCKET-SERVER return a second value to indicate the created underlying usocket object when running in new thread mode. This make server debugging work easier.

[TODO]

* Bugfix: now SOCKET-CONNECT/Datagram works on CLISP
* New feature: CLISP support UDP without RAWSOCK (using FFI interface)
* New feature: CLISP support some advanced TCP features which CLISP's SOCKET interface not provide
* New feature: Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) support Datagram sockets (UDP)
